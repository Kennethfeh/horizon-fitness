# Horizon Fitness Landing

Concept marketing site + blueprint for a hybrid fitness brand.

## Overview
- **Brief**: Design a hybrid fitness marketing site that demonstrates how I bridge brand storytelling and product UI.
- **Role**: Solo designer from sitemap → high-fidelity UI → handoff package.
- **Outcome**: Responsive landing page + blueprint + docs + Figma file.

## Features
- High-fidelity marketing page with hero, metrics, program pillars, schedule, coaches, and testimonials.
- `/blueprint` route detailing sitemap, grids, motion, and developer checklist.
- `/docs` folder outlining the design system + architecture decisions.

## Process & Decisions
1. **Architecture** – Sitemap + wireframes live in `/blueprint`, giving recruiters insight into structure before visuals.
2. **Visual Language** – Warm gradient palette, pill buttons, and card surfaces captured inside `docs/design-system.md`.
3. **Handoff** – Motion/ARIA notes plus the Figma reference ensure engineers can implement without extra meetings.

## Accessibility + UX
- Skip link, focus rings, descriptive aria copy, and WCAG-compliant colors.
- Motion + hover cues documented for developers.
- Purposeful copy tied to the job brief to show messaging craft.
