## Flow Summary
1. Hero anchors the positioning (hybrid fitness).
2. Metrics provide credibility, leading into program pillars.
3. Schedule and coaches demonstrate the product UX.
4. Blueprint page and docs show handoff rigor.

## Wireframe Guidance
- Desktop uses 12-column layout; mobile stacks modules with `gap-6`.
- Buttons have 48px tap targets.
- Imagery slots defined as gradient placeholders until photography arrives.

## Deliverables
- Marketing page + blueprint route.
- `docs/design-system.md` for tokens, `docs/architecture.md` for flow.
- Update README with final deployment URL + Figma file before submitting to Vercel reviewers.
